Negative Feedback Loop (V- is negative):
    Eq Derivation at 27:34
    V_err = V_in-V_fb
    V_fb unchanged, A > 0, f > 0: V_in increases -> V_err increases -> V_out increases -> V_fb increases -> V_err decreases... V_in stabilizes
    Eq 1. V_out = AV+/1+Af
        Use resistors to determine f, which in turn determines the scaling factor of V_out/V_in
        V_out scales V_in by a factor of A/1+Af
        V- = V_fb = f V_out = f A V+/1+Af (approaches 1 as A -> infty)
    V_out approaches V+/f as A -> infty
        Amps does not have to be very precise, just very large
    Changes to V_in should cause V_err to decrease (V_fb increases in V_in increases and decreases if V_in decreases)

Positive Feedback Loop (V- is positive):
    V_in continuously increases (V+ is positive): V_out hits max rail
    V_in continuously decreases (V- is negative): V_out hits min rail

Determining Negative Feedback Exists:
GR 1. I- = 0, so analyze circuit between V_out and V_fb
V_fb = R_2V_out/R_1R_2 : f = R_2/R_1R_2
Negative feedback exists

Analyzing complex OpAmp Circuits:
    Use GR 1 to locate open circuits (I=0)
    Split OpAmps by open circuits and V_out
    Determine if negative feedback loop exists (V_fb increases in V_in increases and decreases if V_in decreases) (If positive feedback loop exists, V_out will hit the rails)
    Apply GR 2 with KCL to determine current flows
    Analyze individual voltage drops across each resistor from V_in to V_fb to V_out : get V_out

Example OA2 : inverting amplifier
    Inverts the sign and is determined by the ratio of the two resistors
    V_fb =  -R_2 V_out/R_1

Find Polarity of OpAmp:
Polarity of inverse amplifier should be the opposite sign of the disturbance
    If V^+ is inserted as positive, the polarity of OpAmp must be negative to generate a proper negative feedback
