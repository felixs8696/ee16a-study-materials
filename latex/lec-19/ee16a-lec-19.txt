\subsection*{Positioning (Acoustic Locationing)}
%%%% Notes %%%%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Need $d+1$ known points/distances to determine position in $d$ dimension
    \item 2D - intersection of 3 circles
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Keep track of Time}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine distance from time it takes signal to arrive at receiver divided by the speed of the signal
    \item Need reference time $t_o$
    \item Synchronized clocks between receiver and beacon
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Time Sampling}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuous signal is a function $a(t) \R \mapsto \R$
    \item Sample the signal every $T$ seconds (sampling period (secs))
    \item Sample frequency $\frac{ 1T} Hz$
    \item This defines a new \textbf{discrete time signal} that is defined only the integers: $a(t), \Z \mapsto \R$
    \item $a_[n]=a_{CT}(nT_s)$ discrete to continuous
    \item Compute delay between receiver and beacon in terms of samples and map make to continuous time using the time period (inverse of frequency)
    \item $y'[n]=y[n-k]$ implies that $y'$ shifts $y$ to the right by $k$ discrete time samples ($k$ sample delay)
\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Delays Linear Algebra:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Stack all values of discrete time signals into a vector
    \item Account for delay by cyclicly shifting down
    \item Use a Circulant Matrix to do the cyclic shift
\end{itemize}
\end{mdframed}
\textbf{Orthogonality}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To measure 'similarity' of vectors, use dot products $\rightarrow$ inner product
    \item Inner product: $\langle\vec{x},\vec{y}\rangle=x^Ty^*$
    \item $y^*$: complex conjugate of $y$
    \item Complex conjugate of $a+ib = a-ib$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}$
    \item Complex values not in scope of class, so inner product = dot product for non-complex vectors
    \item Dot product: $x \cdot y=x^Ty$
\end{itemize}
