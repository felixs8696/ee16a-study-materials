Thevenin/Norton Circuit Practice

Lecture 13 Notes:
Thevenin/Norton circuits have same relationship between Voltage in the circuit and the Current coming out of it as the original circuit (does not say anything about inside the actual circuit)
Ex. Power consumed by original circuit does not equal the power consumed by the T/N circuit (Power is non-linear)

Measure x=position of 2D Touch Screen:
Conductive strips on top plate (top: E1, bottom: E2)
Conductive strips on bottom plate (left: E3, right: E4)
Fig1. Connect Voltage source between E1, E2
Fig2. Connect Voltage source between E3, E4
Both: Measure the voltage between E2, E4 (open circuit) to get Vout over the second resistor of the plate in question
    Fig1. Vout = V4
    Fig2. Vout = V2
        Use Vout in a voltage divider equation to get the x and y positions

Passive Sign Convention:
Current must flow into the positive side of a voltage drop

Capacitor:
2 pieces of conductive material (can have current/resistance)
Separated by non-conductive substance
Applied voltage builds up positive charge on one piece and negative charge on the other
Capacitance = relationship between charge stored and voltage across it: C (farad) = Q/V

d = distance between parallel plates
e = epsilon (permittivity of substance between plates)
A = cross sectional area of plate
C = (eA)/d

Once Q = CV on surface of plate, current stops flowing
I = dQ/dt and Q = CV, therefore, I = C(dV/dt)

Energy stored in capacitor = .5CV^2
(depends on voltage stored in capacitor)

Parallel Capacitance (sum: same as series resistors) C_1...C_n:
C_par = C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n

Series Capacitance (inverse of sum of inverses: same as parallel resistors)
C_1...C_n:
C_ser = (C_1C_2...C_n) / (C_1 + C_2 + ... + C_n) = C_1 || C_2
