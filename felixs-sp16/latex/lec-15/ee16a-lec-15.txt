Circuit: Create fixed charge by running a current for a fixed amount of time and dumping that charge on a variable capacitor and V = Q/C, so you get a variable voltage

Scaling OpAmps:
Example at 46:53
DAC Vmax  = 3.3V, Vmin= 0
Most speakers can be modeled with an 8ohm resistor to ground
Need OpAmp to scale VDAC to the range of the speaker without creating a blocking pattern

Negative Feedback Loop:
Compare input against scaled feedback (from output)
Feed result into a linear gain (A) to produce the output
Send output into scaled feedback loop to compare against input
    If feedback > input, error is negative, output is pushed down, which causes the feedback to go down... etc.
    feedback will approach the input

Golden Rules:
1. I+ = I- = 0 (always true for ideal op amps)
2. V+ = V- (only true with negative feedback)

OpAmp Negative Feedback Loop Analysis:
Input voltage connected to OpAmp, with Vout
Negative Feedback loop with two resistors between Vout and V- 
    Because V- is an open circuit, I1 = I2
GR 1. I+ = I- = 0
    KCL at node between R_1, R_2: I_1 = I_2 (because I- = 0)
GR 2. V+ = V-
    V+ = V- : V_in = Vfb
Ohm's Law on R_2 because V_2 = V_fb:
    I_2 = V_fb/R_2 = V_in/R_2 = I_1
KVL of path from ground to V_out through R_1:
    V_out = V_fb+I_1 R_1 = V_in+V_in R_1/R_2 = V_in(1+R_1/R_2)
