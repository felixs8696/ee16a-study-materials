Capacitor touch screen
Variable capacitance: determines if finger touched
    1. Charge variable capacitor to a fixed voltage
    2. Because Q = CV, capacitance varies and voltage is now fixed, charge Q now varies.
    3. Move Q onto another fixed capacitor
    4. Because V = Q/C, determines the varying voltage

Switch Diagrams:
Analyze each phase of the diagram with one switched as ideal wires and off switches as open circuits
    Capacitors have no resistance in the scope of this class
    Total charge is conserved between switch phases

Charge Sharing:
Phase 1: Accumulate charge on variable capacitor
Phase 2: Distribute charge between variable and fixed capacitor evenly through parallel
Calculate total charge in Phase 1 (fixed C should be 0, var C should be Q)
Calculate total charge in Phase 2 in terms of V out (Q fixed = C_fixed V_out, Q_var = C_var V_out)
Equate two charge and solve for V_out

If you attach a resistor to parallel capacitors, it will dissipate all energy in capacitors across the resistor very quickly (capacitors discharge)

New component (op amp acts as a buffer):
    1. Take analog voltage created by switch/capacitor system, and force it to be either 0V or 5V
    2. Want this to act as an open circuit with infinite resistance (no voltage drop/current)

Op-Amp: 
Example derivation (1:05:28)
Triangle with 5 terminals (V+, V-, Vout, VDD, VSS)
Equivalent to dependent voltage source (value depends on another voltage in circuit measured) that measures voltage between V+ and V- (open circuit), and produces a voltage = A x (V+-V-) = Vout
Needs to be connected to 2 power sources (VPP, VNN)
A ideally infinite scale factor, which would cause infinite Vout, but you cannot produce a Vout outside of the range of VDD (VPP) - VSS (VNN) (Vout min = VSS, Vout max = VDD})

Capacitor Touch Screen:
Want V_out to be 5V on touch, and 0V on no touch
Connect Charge sharing parallel capacitors to Op-Amp:
    • V_var (V_ana) = V+, Vref = V-, V_DD = 5V, V_SS = ground (0)
    • Choose V_ref and C_fixed s.t. V_ana > V_ref on touch, and V_ana < V_ref when not touching
    • C_notouch is eA/d : 1 capacitor between E_1, E2
    • C_touch is C_notouch + (C_fin, E_1)||(C_fin, E_2) : (Cadds two more capacitors in parallel (C_fin, E_1)(C_fin,  E_2)
