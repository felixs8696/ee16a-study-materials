# Berkeley Spring 2016 EE16A Study Materials
Notes on Berkeley EE16A Spring 2016 Lectures and a few extra final study resources
Contains:
    * Final Exams from previous years to practice
    * LaTex notes I took from lectures 10-28 in the `/latex/` folder
    * Compiled document of all the notes in the `/pdf/` folder
*Note: Minor errors may exist. Feel free to make any edits to the .tex files, but make sure to recompile and add the edited pdf to BOTH the correct lecture folder and the compiled document `/pdf/lec10_28.pdf`*
